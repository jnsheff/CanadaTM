In addition to the csv and dta folders containing the dataset files, this repository also includes python scripts that can be used to download the CIPO IP Horizons historical trademarks data via SFTP and construct the csv data files. These scripts are also licensed for reuse subject to the terms of the CC-BY-4.0 license, and users are invited to adapt the scripts to their needs. These scripts require the user to obtain SFTP credentials from CIPO using the registration link provided at https://ised-isde.survey-sondage.ca/f/s.aspx?s=59f3b3a4-2fb5-49a4-b064-645a5e3a752d&lang=EN&ds=SFTP. They also require storage media with at least 70GB of free space. The python scripts can be found in the "py" folder within this repository.

Finally, this repository also includes Stata do-files used to convert the csv data files to .dta format and conduct the analyses set forth in the paper describing the dataset (forthcoming). These do-files are also licensed for reuse subject to the terms of the CC-BY-4.0 license, and users are invited to adapt the scripts to their needs.  The do-files can be found in the "do" folder within this repository.
